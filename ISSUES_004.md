1) the contrast in the app selector and device selector is poor.  use black text on white background in general.

2) In the app selector, the app buttons should use the same color scheme that is used for the app buttons in the main window.  Also, all app buttons should be equal width.  Also, all app buttons should have equal height.

3) I'm still seeing missing apps listed in favorites.  e.g. hulu is not installed, yet there is a favorite button showing in the main window.  apps not installed should not have entries in favorites. Investigate and fix or write an investigation report to FAVORITE_APP_NOT_LISTED.md.  No need to write the report if the bug is likely fixed.

4) Create a document DPAD_CENTER_LONGPRESS.md that describes if and how a long-press on the dpad center can be transmitted to the appletv.  If it is a straightforward matter to sense and send a long press, do so also.
