1) When the list of apps is loaded, if there are any apps that were selected to be displayed on the remote, but aren't in the list of apps, then remove that app from the selection.  e.g. if Hulu is selected for display, but the app list doesn't contain hulu, then remove hulu from the selected apps.

2) The devices selection window has poor contrast, bright green on white is hard to read.  choose from a known good pallete for colors.

3) The apps selection window should contain a scrollable area with buttons for each app instead of names.  The boxes should be similar size and spacing as in the main window, although there may be more than three per row.  The selected app buttons should have a bright green border, and no border for apps that are not selected.  At the bottom of the window is a "OK" button to close the app selection window.

4) Whenever a quick-launch app button is selected, make a note in the log, including the prior app (or unknown if the data is unavailable or if we know that no app was running)
